We envision our game to be similar to that of Whack-A-Mole, where an object will randomly appear on the  screen, and the user will have to wack it. We plan on adding some variety in the type, size and overall gameplay of the moles as well. After a certain amount of "whacks", the moles will start to appear more rapidly and in greater succession, as te SCALE of the speed that the moles appear increases throughout the game.

- [ ] The moles appear on the screen in random places.                                                                                                   
- [ ] The user clicks on them to wack them.The user gets point for wacking the bad moles, butmust avoid wacking the good moles.                          
- [ ] As more and more moles are wacked, and the user's score increases, the moles appear in more rapid succesion. The game ends when 10 moles are missed or 3 good moles are wacked
