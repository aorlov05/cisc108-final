# Moleaga

Do your best to collect ammo and shoot moles with your player cannon, all while dodging shots from enemy moles.


## About

Moleaga is Whack-A-Mole and Galaga mashed together!
Moles randomly appear on the screen and the player has to move their cannon to shoot them. 
There is a 10% chance that a mole is mini, which makes it harder to hit. There is also a 10% chance that a mole is a rabbit, which you should avoid shooting or else lose a lot of points!
After every level passed, the moles will start to appear more rapidly and in greater succession, so the SCALE of the speed that the moles appear increases throughout the game.
The bad moles, which look like mice, will shoot back, and every time you're hit, you lose a life.
You lose the game after losing 3 lives, and your goal is to get the highest score possible!
