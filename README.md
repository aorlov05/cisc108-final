# CISC 108 Project

We envision our game to be similar to that of Whack-A-Mole, where an object will randomly appear on the screen, and the user will have to wack it. We plan on adding some variety in the type, size and overall gameplay of the moles as well. After a certain amount of "whacks", the moles will start to appear more rapidly and in greater succession, as the SCALE of the speed that the moles appear increases throughout the game.
