We envision our game to be similar to that of Whack-A-Mole, where an object will randomly appear out of
1 of 9 holes, and the user will have to wack it. After a certain amount of "whacks", the moles will start
to appear more rapidly and in greater succession, as te SCALE of the speed increases throughout the game.
